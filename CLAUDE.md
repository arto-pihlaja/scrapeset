# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a project to scrape text from the web and analyse it using an LLM. 

## Development Setup

The project starts from scratch. 
First plan, then implement.
Write a high level plan of actions to docs/todo.md
Since this is a new project, you'll need to:

1. Initialize the project based on the intended technology stack (Python, Node.js, etc.)
2. Set up appropriate package management files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Initialize git repository if version control is needed
4. Create initial project structure based on requirements

## Notes

- No existing build, test, or lint commands are configured
- No documentation or configuration files exist yet
- Project structure and architecture will need to be established based on specific requirements
