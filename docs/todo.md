   - URL validation and fetching with retry strategy
   - HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup
   - Text extraction with configurable minimum length filtering
   - Text element filtering and preview generation (50 words)

- [x] **Text Processing Module** (`src/text/`)
   - Text chunking for vector storage with configurable size/overlap
   - Text cleaning and preprocessing (whitespace, punctuation normalization)
   - Token counting with tiktoken
   - Preview text generation

- [x] **Vector Store Module** (`src/vector/`)
   - Chroma database setup and management with persistent storage
   - Document embedding and storage using default sentence transformers
   - Similarity search functionality with metadata filtering
   - Collection management (clear, delete by URL, stats)

- [x] **LLM Interface Module** (`src/llm/`)
   - LiteLLM integration supporting multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter)
   - RAG query processing with context document formatting
   - Response generation with source tracking

### Phase 2: User Interface (CLI)
- [x] **CLI Application** (`src/cli/`)
   - Main application entry point with Typer
   - Interactive user prompts for text element selection
   - Commands: scrape, query, chat, status, clear
   - Rich console output with progress indicators

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
- [x] **Main Application Logic** (`src/main.py`)
   - Complete workflow orchestration
   - Error handling and user feedback
   - Configuration and logging setup

- [x] **Testing & Validation**
   - Basic unit tests for scraper and text processor modules
   - End-to-end CLI functionality verified
   - Error case handling implemented

## ðŸŽ¯ First Simple Version Complete!

The first simple version of web scraping + RAG is now **complete** and **functional**:

### Features Implemented:
1. **Web Scraping**: User can input a URL, scraper extracts text content with filtering
2. **Text Selection**: Interactive CLI allows user to review and select text elements
3. **Vector Storage**: Selected content is chunked and stored in ChromaDB with embeddings
4. **RAG Queries**: Users can ask questions about scraped content with context retrieval
5. **Interactive Chat**: Continuous Q&A session mode
6. **Status Management**: View collection status, sources, and clear data

### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Scrape a website with interactive text selection
python main.py scrape https://example.com

# Ask questions about scraped content
python main.py query "What is the main topic?"

# Start interactive chat session
python main.py chat

# Check collection status
python main.py status

# Clear data
python main.py clear
```

### Technical Architecture:
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for scraping, text processing, vector storage, and LLM
- **Configuration**: Environment-based settings with defaults
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Testing**: Unit tests for core functionality
- **CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface with Rich formatting

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Future Iterations)

4. **User Experience**
   - Web interface
   - Configuration profiles
   - Export/import functionality

5. **Performance**
   - Async processing
   - Caching mechanisms
   - Batch operations
