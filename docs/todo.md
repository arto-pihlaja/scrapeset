## ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced RAG Tool with Conversation Memory Complete!

The web scraping + RAG tool with conversation memory is now **complete** and **fully functional**:

### Features Implemented:
1. **Web Scraping**: User can input a URL, scraper extracts text content with filtering
2. **Text Selection**: Interactive CLI allows user to review and select text elements
3. **Vector Storage**: Selected content is chunked and stored in ChromaDB with embeddings
4. **RAG Queries**: Users can ask questions about scraped content with context retrieval
5. **Conversation Memory**: Multi-turn conversations with context retention and history
6. **Interactive Chat**: Continuous Q&A session mode with memory and persistence
7. **Collection Management**: View collection status, sources, and manage multiple collections
8. **Conversation Management**: Save, load, view, and delete conversation histories

### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Scrape a website with interactive text selection
python main.py scrape https://example.com

# Ask questions about scraped content
python main.py query "What is the main topic?"

# Start interactive chat session with memory
python main.py chat

# Start chat without memory
python main.py chat --no-memory

# Chat with auto-save enabled
python main.py chat --save

# List all collections
python main.py collections

# List saved conversations
python main.py conversations --list

# View a specific conversation
python main.py conversations --load abc123de

# Check collection status
python main.py status

# Clear data
python main.py clear
```

### Technical Architecture:
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for scraping, text processing, vector storage, LLM, and conversation memory
- **Conversation Memory**: Multi-turn context retention with configurable memory size and persistence
- **Enhanced RAG**: Context-aware responses combining vector search with conversation history
- **Configuration**: Environment-based settings with defaults for all components
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Testing**: Unit tests for core functionality including conversation memory
- **CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface with Rich formatting
